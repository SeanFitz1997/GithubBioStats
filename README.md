# GithubBioStats
_Serverless application that updates your bio with stats about your Github projects_

__Work In Progress__

This project contains source code for an AWS Lambda serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI.

## Deploy the sample application
This application uses the __SAM CLI__.To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* Java11 - [Install the Java 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)
* Maven - [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:
```bash
$ sam build
$ sam deploy --guided
```
The first command will build the source of your application. 
The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts.
Your choices will be saved to a configuration file so that in the future you can just run `sam deploy`.

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally
Build your application
```bash
$ sam build
```

Invoking a function directly with a test event.
```bash
$ sam local invoke GithubBioStatsFunction --event events/event.json
```

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs
Fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function.
```bash
$ sam logs -n GithubBioStatsFunction --stack-name GithubBioStats --tail
```

## Unit tests
```bash
$ cd GithubBioStatsFunction
$ mvn test
```

## Cleanup
You can delete the deployed application with the following command with the aws cli
or delete the stack on the web console.
```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name GithubBioStats
```
